# File descriptions:
The dataset uploaded to the repository pertains to Mediterranean hurricanes and includes the following components:

Cyclone tracks: This dataset comprises the tracks of cyclones that occurred in the Mediterranean region. It provides information on the movement and paths of these tropical-like storms.

Tracks position and points: This dataset includes specific positions and points along the cyclone tracks. These points serve as reference markers for analyzing the trajectory and intensity of the hurricanes.

Geomorphological evidence: This dataset contains information related to geomorphological features and changes associated with Mediterranean hurricanes. It provides insights into coastal landforms, erosion patterns, and sediment transport influenced by these storms.

Mean sea level pressure isobars: This dataset presents mean sea level pressure isobars for the identified cyclone events. It provides a spatial representation of atmospheric pressure patterns associated with the hurricanes.

Additionally, the dataset includes thermal drop information for each cyclone event, which is provided in raster format (Geotiff). The thermal drop data represents temperature changes during the occurrence of the cyclones.

These datasets collectively offer valuable information for studying and analyzing Mediterranean hurricanes. They enable researchers to assess cyclone characteristics, track movements, investigate associated geomorphological changes, and understand atmospheric pressure variations. The availability of thermal drop data in raster format further facilitates the examination of temperature fluctuations during cyclone events.
